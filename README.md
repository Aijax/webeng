#Web Engineering

Web applications are complex systems that deliver a plethora of features to a large number of users (including developers), and also exhibit unique behaviors and demands in terms of performance, scalability, usability, and security. This course will discuss the limits of current web technologies, information and service architectures, caching, session and data management.

Model-View-Controller, Data Modeling

Two really important outcomes for any good Computer Science curriculum: (1) good design and (2) separation of concerns
Design pattern:

* Reusable practice for designing software
* Proven way, benefits
* Used by many
* Risks are known
* Avoid reinventing the wheel
* Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern

* MVC-based frameworks: iOS, Android, Rails, Django, Backbone.js, AngularJS, ASP, Spring
* Let's concentrate on the the Model. Recall the idea of NoSQL or MongoDB, and example of a NoSQL database. Why NoSQL database?
* Why NOT a NoSQL database? Example:

name	m_f	title	year
Carrie Fisher	f	Star Wars: A New Hope	1977
Carrie Fisher	f	The Empire Strikes Back	1980
Carrie Fisher	f	Return of the Jedi	1983
Mark Hamill	m	Star Wars: A New Hope	1977
Mark Hamill	m	The Empire Strikes Back	1980
Mark Hamill	m	Return of the Jedi	1983
Harrison Ford	m	Star Wars: A New Hope	1977
Harrison Ford	m	The Empire Strikes Back	1980
Harrison Ford	m	Return of the Jedi	1983
Harrison Ford	m	Indiana Jones	1981
* What is a relational database, the relational model?

* Tables => collection of related records
* Rows => records (or tuples)
* Columns => fields adhering to certain data types
* Keys => bindings
* Views => query results
* Schema => blueprint
* Why relational databases?

* Mature
* Productive
* Standards exist (e.g., the Structured Query Language)
* Extensible
* Complex queries can be done
* More security options
* Avoids data duplication
* Easier to change data (if designed correctly)
